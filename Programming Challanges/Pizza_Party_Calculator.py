# Write a program that:

# Stores the number of students in the class
# Stores that each pizza serves 8 people
# Calculate how many pizzas are needed (you may need to round up)
# If each pizza costs Â£12, calculate the total cost
# Display the number of pizzas needed and the total cost
import math

print(f"The number of pizzas needed is: {num_of_pizzas}")
